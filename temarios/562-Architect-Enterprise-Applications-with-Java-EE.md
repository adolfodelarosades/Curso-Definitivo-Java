# 562 Architect Enterprise Applications with JavaEE

DESCRIPTION

Instructor Introduction

**Please Note**: There is no supported environment for this course.

This course teaches you how to develop robust architectures for enterprise Java applications.

BENEFITS TO YOU

You will learn the strategies needed to create application blueprints that work well when implementing Java EE technologies. These strategies include effective decision-making through the use of non-functional qualities (such as scalability and flexibility), Java EE technology blueprints and design patterns.
