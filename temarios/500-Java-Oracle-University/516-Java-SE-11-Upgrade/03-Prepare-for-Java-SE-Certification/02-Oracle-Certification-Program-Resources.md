## 1. Taking your Exam Online - 10m

Hello there. You've signed up for an Oracle certification. Congratulations. In the next few minutes, you will see what to expect when you start the process of taking your exam online and how you can prepare yourself for it.

In this video you will be guided through the steps you will need to perform before you can take your exam online. We will start with the points you need to remember as you prepare your exam environment to comply with exam regulations. You will be guided through the process of accessing your exam through CertView and the OnVUE application, where you will perform system checks and go through the check-in process. You will also be provided links to contact technical support if you require.

First you must find a quiet location with no other people present. Clear your desk of any peripheral devices, secondary monitors, writing material, or any other material that is not required for the exam. We recommend having only your computer, mouse, and charger-- in case of a laptop-- on your desk. Remove all writable surfaces, like books, calendars, and whiteboards from your room where you are taking your exam.

When testing your system prior to the day of the exam, make sure to run that system test on the same computer and network that you will use on the day of the exam. Make sure you have administrative rights on the computer to download and install the required online proctoring software.

Here are some technical specifications that your system should meet before the exam. The recommended operating systems are Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Mac OS 10.9 or higher. The minimum screen resolution is 1024 by 768. If your display supports a higher resolution, it's much better.

You will need a sustained high-speed internet connection for the duration of the exam. Make sure you have a strong internet connection with a speed of 3 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up. Do not use a mobile hotspot.

Supported internet browsers at Internet Explorer 11, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. We recommend the latest version. Use a laptop with a working webcam and an inbuilt microphone. No external headsets or microphones are permitted. Make sure cookies are enabled in your browser and pop-up blockers are disabled.

Disable any VPN connection on your computer and make sure you are not taking this exam behind a company firewall. Also disable virus check software, such as McAfee, since it might slow down your system while taking the exam. Check your system tray or task manager, and make sure you shut down non-essential software. On Windows 10, you can find the system tray at the bottom right of the screen.

Some examples of software that can cause a system check to fail, and which you should avoid running at the time of the system test and exam, are chat software, such as Slack or Jabber; remote access software, such as VNC Server or any other software that allows remote access to your system; any screen capture or recording software, such as Greenshot, Snagit, or Tiny Take; and any non-essential software you see running in the system tray, such as WebEx or printer software.

Make sure all your system checks have passed. And do not proceed if a system check failed. In case you run into issues with the system check, use the Pearson VUE Live Chat option.

Please have your required ID proof handy. You won't be able to take the exam without it. Examples of valid ID proof are a driver's license or a passport.

On the day of your exam, you want to make sure you are ready to take the exam without a hitch. Here's what you need to do. In Step 1, go to your appointment mail, where you will find a link to the Pearson VUE page. Navigate to this page and click on Log In. This will take you to the Oracle CertView login page, where you can perform the second step, which is logging in using your CertView account.

When prompted, enter your Oracle SSO login credentials. You will see your Pearson VUE dashboard, where your upcoming and completed exams are listed. Click on the exam to move to the next step, Beginning Your Exam.

At Step 3, you are ready to begin your exam. The Begin Exam button will be available 30 minutes before your exam start time. Click this button to begin your exam.

You have already tested your computer and internet when you registered for this exam. In Step 4, you will be required to re-test whether your system is ready for the actual exam. Copy the access code, which is required later to verify your identification details using your phone. Click on Download and save the OnVUE dot exe file on your system. Please be patient, as the OnVUE dot exe file is downloaded to your system.

Run the downloaded OnVUE dot exe file. You will then enter the access code you had copied before and your phone number. Your phone number will be used to contact you if there is any issue with the check-in process.

After providing your code and phone number, click on Get Started to begin the check-in process. Step 5 involves a system check, where your microphone, internet speed, and webcam functionality is tested. Please speak into your microphone while the microphone test is happening, or the microphone test may fail. Click on Next once the test passes.

In Step 6, you will perform the check-in process, which involves multiple tasks. You will first need to share photos of yourself, your identification documents, such as a driver's license or passport, and photos of your surrounding workspace. You have two options to take these photos. You can use your mobile phone or your webcam. If you wish to use your mobile phone, please enter your contact information after selecting the preferred access method, else click on Use your Webcam.

If you choose the Text Message access method, you will receive a text message with a URL. Click on this URL to follow the steps to upload your photos. If you choose the Type URL access method, you will be provided a URL you need to type into your mobile browser to follow the same steps to upload your photos. Upload all the required photos.

Before proceeding from this point, please make note of these instructions. No one may enter your workspace. You will not leave your workspace. You have placed mobiles, headphones, and watches out of reach. You will no longer need your mobile phone after this point. Food, drinks, smoking, and gum are prohibited. Water is permitted. Medical devices and pills are permitted.

Close all other applications before proceeding. Please wait until the exam begins. In the meantime, ensure you are in front of your system with your face clearly visible to your webcam until the proctor starts your exam, as well as during the exam. Please wait until the proctor begins your exam. Your Proctor will be available within the next 15 minutes, after which the proctor will verify your surroundings and launch the exam.

If there are issues with the uploaded photos or ID, the proctor will guide you through next steps. If the proctor does not get in touch with you in the next 15 minutes, try to talk to the proctor using your computer microphone. If the proctor does not respond, attempt to restart the exam by going to Step 3 and clicking on Begin Exam. Follow the same process again. If repeating the process does not resolve the issue or you face additional issues while taking your exam, please reach out using the Support links provided.

In this video, you have learned how to prepare your exam environment so that it complies with exam regulations. You have learned the process of accessing your exam through CertView and the OnVUE application and how to perform system checks and go through the check-in process. You have also been provided links to contact technical support if you require.

All the best. We hope you have a successful exam.

## 2. How to access your exam results - 5m

Welcome to this video on how to access your exam results and certification credentials in CertView. We will start with logging into CertView, go through the steps to view your exam results, and also learn how to manage your certification credentials. To log in to CertView, go to education.oracle.com, point to Certification, and click CertView. Alternatively, you can directly visit certview.oracle.com, and log in using your Oracle login ID and password.

This is your CertView homepage. You'll see a navigation menu on the left and important notes about the new CertView portal in the main window. To view your results, click the Results option on the left navigation menu. The first two options here are related to your exam results.

Click the Latest Pearson VUE Exam Results to see the score report of the latest exam that you have taken. Your score report shows your score, the result-- pass or fail-- and provides feedback about your performance. This score report is available to you immediately after you complete the exam with Pearson VUE.

Click Pearson VUE Results History to see all of the historical data of the exams that you have taken so far. You can open the score reports of all of these exams from here as well.

Now let's see how you can view the details of all of the certifications that you have earned so far. Click Credential Management on the left navigation menu. Under that, choose Review Certification History. Credentials appear here within 48 hours after passing the exam at Pearson VUE. If you do not see your credentials here, it could be due to the following reasons. One, you've not allowed 48 hours for your certification to be processed.

Two, you have not completed all of the requirements for the certification track. There are some Oracle certifications which required you to pass more than one exam, for example, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2020 Certified Architect Professional certification. This requires you to have already achieved Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2020 Architect Associate certification, and you should have passed Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2020 Architect Professional 1Z0-997-20 exam.

The third reason why a credential may not show up here is that you've taken the contributing exams under different testing IDs. In that case, you can click My Account and use the option Request to Merge Accounts to submit a request to merge your multiple testing IDs.

Open any certification credential to expand it. Here, you'll see the status of your credential as active or inactive, the date that you achieved it. You have an option here to claim your digital badge. You can also share this digital badge on social media from here. There's also an option to download your e-certificate. Alternatively, you can claim or share your digital badge, download your e-certificate, publish your credentials to third parties using the Credential Management option from the left navigation menu.

If you have any further questions on how to view your results and credential details in CertView, you can contact the Oracle Certification Program Customer Support team from education.oracle.com, Certification, Contact Oracle Certification Support link. Hope this video was useful, and thanks for watching.
