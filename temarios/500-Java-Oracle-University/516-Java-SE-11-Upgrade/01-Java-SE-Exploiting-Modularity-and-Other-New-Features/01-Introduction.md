## 1. Introduction - 18m

Let's go ahead and get into the lectures of these Java SE-- Exploiting Modularity and Other New Features. This is really quite an important milestone in the Java technology, which actually introduced now the modularity at the large level-- which means at the high level, which is at the deployment level-- rather than the fine-grained level. And, of course, it solves many, many of the issues that we had with the previous JVMs and JDKs. And we start with lesson 1.

So lesson 1 talks about the introduction. Here, we're going to just introduce the course for you. And we'll start, again, in this case by looking at the main goals of the course.

This course actually discusses modularity and how it impacts your Java code. In a sense, once you finish coding at the low level using your lambda expressions and your streams and so forth, then, of course, at this point in time you are at a large level where you deal with the design of your modules related to your application. That would be, in this case, the case where the discussion will help you tremendously how you are going to help build your deployment of your application-- in this case, of your Java application, which basically focuses on the latest edition of the JDK 10, for example.

So this course highlights also your other features that are also more significant and widely applicable and, of course, compelling. So we'll start first with modularity. And then, once we finish with that, we get into some other topics related maybe to creating your custom JVM, and then getting into more features in terms of the migration of your application and you're basically pre-JDK 10 application. And then, of course, getting into when we talk about if you want migration of those old Java applications to the new JDK 9 and 10, then, in that case, it would be useful to understand how we do that, which is from a top level, top down, or bottom up, and so forth. We discuss all of that.

And, of course, this course basically supports also the Java SE certification upgrade in case you want to upgrade your certification. This will focus more on the new features that are introduced in the JDK 10.

So the course objectives basically talks about, in this case, describing the Java new module system. We're going to talk about that, which is really quite interesting. And you will see that it is just very, very beneficial to actually learn these concepts because they are going to allow you to build a robust, performant, more flexible, and smaller footprint applications.

We're going to look at packaging and application to leverage the Java module system and how we do all of that. Identify and address common requirements in migrating older applications to modularity. This is, again, the one that I was discussing earlier. And also, working with multi-release JAR files. In a sense, we can have now an application that most probably you have compiled or it has some classes that you compiled using the JDK 7 or 8, and now you want to mix that with some of the classes built using JDK 10-- 9 and 10 and so forth. And how would you go by creating this multi-release JAR file and work with it? We have a lesson that actually talks about that.

We are going to also design interfaces which implement methods. So in JDK 8-- or Java SE 8-- we introduced the concept of default methods in an interface and the static methods implemented inside an interface. Now, we're going to introduce another new feature that we added in the JDK SE 9 and 10, which basically is related to creating a private method. We'll talk about that.

We are going to also look at some very, very useful, convenient methods that we added to the streams and how we process streams. You would see that some of the features that we may be had a little bit-- we had to write a little bit of boiler code to be able to process some of these applications. Then, of course, especially when you're dealing with the option of class, we'll see that some of these convenient methods were created in the SE 9 and 10 to be able actually to solve all these problems.

Looking at, in this case, more convenient method related to collections and array. We're going to take a look at that. We also are going to make a very nice tool which is related to REPL called the JShell. JShell is really good for fast code experiments. And if you want to try to a quick POC, Proof Of Concept, then JShell would be very, very useful to you. And we'll talk about that. And then, we're going to identify the deprecated APIs and possible alternatives. There is a lesson that actually covers that.

So the typical audience for this course would be Java SE developers, Java Enterprise Edition developers, of course Java technical architects because we said the modularity focuses more on the large- the high level if you want-- and the packaging and deployment level. So that's why it would be nice, in this case, to actually help the architects on how to design your modules and how to, of course, create your custom, in this case, JDK if you want.

And then, of course, project management, too. The project managers also will be able to now, with the modularity or the module system, help themselves to actually, in this case, manage the deployment-- the high-level deployment-- and the way they package their application to, of course, be deployed on the production level.

The prerequisite for this course would be we assume that you know how to develop and you're kind of proficient in Java, obviously. And then, of course, have some knowledge in object-oriented since, obviously, Java is object-oriented programming. And, of course, you pretty much work with primitives and classes, and you've created arrays and collections and streams and so forth. Streams are covered in the Java SE 8 program.

We do also, by the way-- and I'll talk about that towards the end of the course-- we do have a five-day versions of this course, and we'll discuss that if you want to get into more details or maybe you don't have enough background. Then, in that case, we'll tell you about the course that actually fits that, or you want to learn more details and so forth. Of course, knowing a little bit about operating system command line because we run this on Linux platform. So in some of the cases, we need to use some of the OS commands to process something.

So here's the course map. Of course, JDK 9 and 10 are part of the Jigsaw product. First, we're going to discuss why modules and why suddenly now this is important to us. We're going to work with module system. We going to, of course, look at how the JDK is now divided into modules, where we call it modular JDK. And then, after that, we are going to get into creating our custom runtime image-- our runtime JDK image-- and this using a very, very nice command that we added in the Java SE 10, which is related to the, in this case, jlink.

We are going also to discuss migration-- how to migrate pre-JDK 9 and 10 applications to JDK 10. We're going to look at how to create services, and then, of course, talk about multi-release JAR files.

After that, we get into the JShell, which is a very, very nice REPL features that we added. We are going to also look at enhancement of the interface by adding the private method to the interface. Then, we're going to look at some enhancement with convenience methods that we added to the streams-- processing streams-- and collections and arrays. And then, of course, we finish this quick course using the deprecation of the APIs.

So pretty much, this is more or less a schedule-- what are we going to cover more or less between, again, the lecture and the practices and so forth for every single lesson. That's what we have. This is pretty much for the first day, and this would be for the second day.

So, of course, the way we are going to cover this course, we are going to tackle the different lessons. We're going to look at the slides. Plus, in addition, we're going to look at some sample code. And there are some demos that we can use to explain the concepts. We'll also give you some short quizzes at the end of every module so you can go ahead and basically use them to review what you have learned in the lesson.

We also give you practices, and these are hands-on learning type of practices that are really, really good. Every lesson has practices. And these practices are intended for, in this case, you to learn or, if you want, to apply what you learned in the lessons. And they are intended for an OU practice environment.

So we'll show you about that environment, and this environment basically is, in our case here, a lab environment that we provide you. And this lab environment, basically, it's a Unix type of environment. It's Linux. And, of course, open, that means I already opened it. And then, you can make use of the different project-- either the projects that we have willl provide to you in the examples, or practices that you are going to, of course in this case, do for every lesson.

So this is pretty much showing you the environment, the practice environment that we gave you. So you have your JDK 9 or 10. Again, 9 and 10 are exactly the same-- just a couple of enhancements and the [INAUDIBLE] in 10 in terms of the garbage collection and a couple of other things. But other than that, pretty much it works very nicely with JDK 10.

We've got NetBeans that already installed-- you're going to make use of it-- and Firefox in case you want to look at the API. We also have tools that are already installed part of the JDK 10-- JLink, JShell, and JDeprscan. We can take a look at all of that. We also added an old , JDK which is 8, and that means 8.2 also. And all these are, of course, installed on the Oracle Linux Environment.

So basically, the way we added these new features or these new APIs is following the JDK enhancement proposal, which we call it JEP. It is pretty much a proposal to design and implement a non-trivial change to the JDK. In the sense, there is an advanced changes into the JDK. We're going to talk about especially the modularization.

These JEP specifications are governed through the Java Community Process, JCP, and they are proposed, explored, and revised by members of the JCP. Members of JCP are individual developers, companies, Oracle, and basically a whole group of, in this case, members. And, of course, once the consensus is arrived or reached on a particular specification, it will become part of the API. The JDK roadmap consists of a list of proposals that are approved JEPs that, of course, are decided by the whole team. And the course topics examine major features specified by recent JEPs.

What's not covered then this course is pretty much the HTTP/2 client-- we are part of JEP 110-- and the JEP 249, which talks about the OCSP stapling for TLS. Again, the benefit is provided automatically. We'll get these benefits just by upgrading your JDK to 10 or higher-- in this case, 9, 10 and so forth. Right now, we're using 10. And benefits are highlighted on the next couple of slides.

Here are some of the benefits. JEP 250, store interned Strings in a class sharing objectives. It reduces memory consumption by sharing the String object and in the line. JEP 143 improves contented locking. JEP 254 for compact String-- less memory used for storing Strings. JEP 232 vary improves secure application performance. JEP 246, leverage CPU instructions for, in this case, the GHASH and RSA.

JEP 215, tiered attribution for javac-- which, again, in this case compolier is much faster in figuring out the correct type of an expression. JEP 225, Javadoc search. JEP 265, Marlin Graphics Renderer. It's better performance for graphics. JEP 263 is, again, the HiDPI graphics on Windows and Linux. JEP 283, enable GTK 3 on Linux. And, of course, JEP 257, update JavaFX/Media to a newer version of the GStreamer.

Some additional resources we added for you just so that, pretty much, if you want to read more about the training that we offer or the documentation of the API or you want to download your JPM and a bunch of other articles and blogs and so forth. And then, the forum and the tutorial.

Some more additional resources-- part of the Java documentation and What's New in the 9 and 10, the Migration Guide, and the JShell User's Guide.

And that's pretty much what I wanted to say in this lesson, first lesson, which is about the introduction to the course. Thank you.

## 2. Practice 1-1 to Practice 1-5 - 5m

And now that we're done with Lesson 1, let's go out and take a look at its practices. We start with Practice 1. Basically, that's to a connect to your lab machine. And we go ahead and do that. So in my case here, I'm connecting to my lab machine. And that's what I have.

Then after that, they want us to just open a terminal. So we'll go ahead and open my terminal application systems and terminal so in case we need it later on.

Then number 3, we just want to verify the version of the Java installed and then of course the JShell. Let's go ahead and do that. So here, we're going to just put down java-version. That would be nine and then start the JShell. At some point in time, we'll work with JShell. Of course, now that we're done, we'll go ahead and execute JShell.

Then of course, here, just opening a text file. So basically open the home directory and then just open the read-me file. Let's go ahead and do that. So under Oracle, go to Labs, and then Introduction and then in practice here, we have read-me and then G edit. That's just opening a text file in case you want to open it. It let's you edit.

After that, we start NetBeans and we opened the project and just run it. Let's go ahead and do that. So in our case here, we'll just go ahead and start NetBeans.

Here's my NetBeans got started.

I'm just going to close these projects. I was just playing with them earlier.

And then, of course, they ask us to open a project. That would be in number one. Here it is. And this is just a Java project that has a class that basically tests the version, get property and then the Java version.

If I run this, I can run it from the file itself. Or I can run it from and that will be my output here that you see. I can go ahead and increase the fonts here, so we can see it bigger. And that's basically what they want us to do in the practices of Lesson 1.
