# Java EE 6: Develop Web Services with JAX-WS and JAX-RS Ed 1

DESCRIPTION

This Java EE 6 programming course covers the design and creation of SOAP and RESTful web services and clients. You'll use the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop JAX-WS and JAX-RS web services and deploy those services to Oracle WebLogic Server 12c. The majority of topics covered are portable across all application servers which support the Java EE 6 web service standards.

**Learn To:**

* Create XML documents and XML schemas while using XML Namespaces.
* Produce and consume JSON and XML using JAXB.
* Understand WSDL files and the role they play in SOAP based web services and select either a top-down (WSDL first) or bottom-up (code first) approach to the development of SOAP web services.
* Make calls to and implement web services based on SOAP standards using JAX-WS (Metro Stack).
* Implement REST practices in the creation of web services with the JAX-RS specification (Jersey Stack).
* Secure web services using Java EE Security standards, WS-Security extensions, and OAuth 1.0a.

BENEFITS TO YOU

Java EE 6 technology facilitates cross-platform application development through the use of platform neutral network communication, supports HTML5 AJAX enabled applications and mobile clients by creating RESTful web services which use the JSON data-interchange format. Enrolling in this course will help you stay current on the latest Java EE 6 web service APIs.
