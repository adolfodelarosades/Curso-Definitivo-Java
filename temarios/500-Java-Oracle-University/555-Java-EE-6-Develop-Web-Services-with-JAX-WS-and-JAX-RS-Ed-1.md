# Java EE 6: Develop Web Services with JAX-WS and JAX-RS Ed 1

DESCRIPTION
This Java EE 6 programming course covers the design and creation of SOAP and RESTful web services and clients. You'll use the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop JAX-WS and JAX-RS web services and deploy those services to Oracle WebLogic Server 12c. The majority of topics covered are portable across all application servers which support the Java EE 6 web service standards.

Learn To:

Create XML documents and XML schemas while using XML Namespaces.
Produce and consume JSON and XML using JAXB.
Understand WSDL files and the role they play in SOAP based web services and select either a top-down (WSDL first) or bottom-up (code first) approach to the development of SOAP web services.
Make calls to and implement web services based on SOAP standards using JAX-WS (Metro Stack).
Implement REST practices in the creation of web services with the JAX-RS specification (Jersey Stack).
Secure web services using Java EE Security standards, WS-Security extensions, and OAuth 1.0a.
BENEFITS TO YOU
Java EE 6 technology facilitates cross-platform application development through the use of platform neutral network communication, supports HTML5 AJAX enabled applications and mobile clients by creating RESTful web services which use the JSON data-interchange format. Enrolling in this course will help you stay current on the latest Java EE 6 web service APIs.
