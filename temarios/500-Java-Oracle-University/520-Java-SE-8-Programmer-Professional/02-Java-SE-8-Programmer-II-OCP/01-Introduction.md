Welcome to Java Programmer 2 certification and preparation workshop. I'm Raymond Gallardo, principal technical writer at Oracle. I'm also one of the co-authors of the Java tutorials.

Because you're watching this video, we're assuming that you are taking the next step to becoming Java certified. The Java SE 8 Programmer 2 exam is 150 minutes long. There are 85 questions, and a passing score is 65%. The format is the same as the Java SE 8 Programmer 1 exam-- multiple choice. Go to this website for more information about this exam.

So there are 12 sections, covering 56 topics. So the difference between Programmer 1 and this exam is that the topics cover a larger scope and the questions are more difficult, because we're assuming that you do have some hands-on Java experience. So these are the 12 topics we are going to be covering. We are in slide 5 of 208, so enjoy.
