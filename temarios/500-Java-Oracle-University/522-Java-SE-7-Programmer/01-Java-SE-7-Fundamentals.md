# 01 Java SE 7 Fundamentals

DESCRIPTION

Develop a solid understanding of what the Java SE7 platform is and how it is used in real world applications. Use various Java programming language constructs to create several Java technology applications. Use decision and looping constructs and methods to dictate program flow. Perform basic error handling for your Java technology programs. Implement intermediate Java programming and object-oriented (OO) concepts in Java technology programs. Demonstrate knowledge of Java technology and the Java programming language. Create and use simple Java classes containing arrays, loops and conditional constructs. Use and manipulate object references. Write simple error handling code. Use basic object oriented concepts like inheritance, encapsulation and abstraction.

Note: This legacy course is provided seminar-style, without a supported lab environment.

BENEFITS TO YOU

This legacy course helps you form a solid basis in the Java programming language upon which to base continued work and training. It features the Java Platform, Standard Edition 7 (Java SE 7), and uses the Java SE Development Kit 7 (JDK 7) product.
