# 02 Java SE 7 Programming

DESCRIPTION

This course covers the core Application Programming Interfaces (API) you will use to design object-oriented applications with Java.

Create Java technology applications with the latest JDK 7 Technology and the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Enhance object-oriented thinking skills using design patterns and best practices. Identify good practices in the use of the language to create robust Java applications. Manipulate files, directories and file systems. Write database applications using standard SQL queries through JDBC. Create high-performance multi-threaded applications. Develop applications that manipulate files, directories and file systems.

This course will also teach you how to create classes that subclass other classes, extend abstract classes and program with interfaces. Expert Oracle instructors will illustrate how you can properly use exceptions, as well as the Collections framework.

You'll also learn to write database programs with JDBC, as well as how to correctly write multi-threaded applications. You can utilize this course to further develop your skills with the Java language.

Note: This legacy course is provided seminar-style, without a supported lab environment.

BENEFITS TO YOU

Boost the productivity, communication and collaboration of your organization. At the same time, reduce the cost of application ownership through more efficient development and deployment techniques. Maintain your edge by staying current with the global standard for developing networked applications.
