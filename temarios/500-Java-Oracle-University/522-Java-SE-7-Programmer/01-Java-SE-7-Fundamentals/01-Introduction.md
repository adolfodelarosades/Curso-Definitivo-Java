## 1. Introduction - 2m

Hello, my name is Boulenouar. And I am a senior principal instructor with Oracle University. I will be delivering this Java SE fundamentals. I have been doing Java for a long time from the Java SC to the Java EE to the Java ME to the Java FX and all pretty much the Java technologies. In this particular course, we are going to look at a bunch of interesting concepts that will help you learn Java, of course. This would be the concept of the features of the Java technology, like object oriented, the fact that it's object oriented, and the fact that it is distributed, and the fact that it's platform independent.

And then we get into the concept of classes and how we declare classes and how we work with objects that do have attributes and, of course, have methods. And we learn how to work with fields that how to declare them, initialize them, and so forth. We get into also the concept of the conditional constructs and the loops and so forth. We'll also learn about arrays and array lists. And we get into the concept of inheritance values studying what's a super class and what's a sub-class. And we also finish by deploying a simple Java application using the Oracle based IDE.

I hope you enjoy the course and looking forward to covering all these interesting topics that, of course, will help you to become Java developers. Thank you.
