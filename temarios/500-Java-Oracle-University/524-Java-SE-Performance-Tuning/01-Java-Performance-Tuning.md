# 01 Java Performance Tuning

DESCRIPTION

In this course, you will learn how to Monitor, profile and tune your Java applications, to use command line and visual tools to perform profiling.  You will learn to get hands on practice with Visual VM, Java Mission Control, Flight Recorder and the NetBeans IDE. You will also learn to effectively use the profiling tools and techniques to analyze JVM. 

BENEFITS TO YOU

Learn how Java garbage collection works and how it affects your applications. Learn how to select the appropriate garbage collector and performance goal for your applications. Finally, use the Mission Control and Java Flight Recorder tools to monitor and analyze your applications.
