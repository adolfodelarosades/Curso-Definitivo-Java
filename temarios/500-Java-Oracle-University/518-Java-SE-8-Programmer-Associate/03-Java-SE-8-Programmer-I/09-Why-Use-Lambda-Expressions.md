## 1. Why Use Lambda Expressions? - 2m

Fundamentally, a Lambda Expression is just a little piece of code. But a Lambda Expression allows you to express that code in a very, very concise fashion. The only way to do this previously, that is prior to Java 8, was to use anonymous inner classes. And those were so cumbersome that basically people didn't use it. So the conciseness of Lambda Expressions really opens up a new set of programming techniques that weren't available before.

And the main one of these is it allows you to pass code around as if it were data. So for instance, using a Lambda Expression, you could pass a bit of code as a parameter to a method. Or you could pass a bit of code as the return value from a method. And that's something that has really not been present in Java prior to Java 8.
