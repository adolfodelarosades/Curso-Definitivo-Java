Welcome to the Java Basics learning path, where we introduce the world of Java and the fundamentals of Java programming. My name is Joe Greenwald. I'm a senior principal instructor and learning solution architect with Oracle University. My background is in model-based development, case tools, and object-oriented analysis and design programming.

I got my start with objects in the late '80s with Object Pascal-- some of you may remember Borland Turbo Pascal and Delphi products-- followed by Smalltalk and C++. I've been working with Java since it was first created and taught the first Java classes for Oracle University. I've been working with and teaching Java ever since.

Java is widely used in the industry, and learning Java is applicable to many different roles, not just the obvious developer and designer roles. All manner of tech folks can benefit from knowing Java-- support engineers, QA engineers, even administrators and architects. Also, proficiency with Java is a highly marketable skill. This learning path serves as an introduction to our Java learning subscription, which can be your one-stop shop for your Java education and training needs.

This learning path contains two parts. The first is an overview of the world of Java, and the second is a course to teach you basic programming skills in Java. Let's take a look at the objectives for the world of Java.

Our first objective is to become familiar with why Java was invented and the different ways that it is used, from smart cards to TVs to the enterprise. Then we'll briefly examine the structure of a typical Java program to see what it looks like. We'll also consider the Java design mindset. How do we design using object-oriented principles and Java features to increase code reuse and create code that is easier to maintain and extend?

We'll examine some of the more common Application Programming Interfaces, APIs, included with the Java Development Kit. These are libraries of classes that add functionality to our applications and make it easier to create robust, industrial-grade applications. And lastly, we'll look at how Java is used in the enterprise, which is where we see it used most often today.

I hope my experience and enthusiasm for Java is contagious, and you leave feeling entertained, enlightened, and eager to get started programming with Java. Let's get started.
